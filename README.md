Tech choice reasoning:
- Because I had to make a script feeding data into a js environment, I chose to do the script in TS rather than Python because it's a much easier integration and in the same environment.
- TS also has static typing which makes the code more robust and more specific compiler errors/warnings relative to JS.
- I chose React over Vue because I utilized an analytics library I've used in the past that was well liked by clients. However I prefer Vue's simplicity over React, it makes frontend a bit easier, but 
  React has richer analytic visualization library options.
